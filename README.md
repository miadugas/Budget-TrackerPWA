# Budget-TrackerPWA

**Ok so they didn't teach you about "budgets" in school**
-Have recent NSF fees sent you into a depression?
-Are you wondering why mom and dad are always hesitant now about "just helping you out one more time?"
-Can you not control that urge to get just one more guitar?

Hey, you got this now!
