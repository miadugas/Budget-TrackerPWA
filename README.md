# Budget-TrackerPWA

**Ok so they didn't teach you about "budgets" in school**

-Have recent NSF fees sent you into a depression?

-Are you wondering why mom and dad are always hesitant now about "just helping you out one more time?"

-Can you not control that urge to get just one more guitar?

Hey, you got this now! 
As part of my "Adulting Series" of apps you now have a Budget Tracker to help you stay on the right side (positive side) of your bank account.

Track your spending, be an adult and never say the phrase " I should be ok" 

You'll be able to add expenses and deposits to your budget with or without an internet onnection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
